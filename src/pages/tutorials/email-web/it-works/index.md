#### Send an Email

##### Deploy

Now that your API requests are ready, you can deploy your project again so that the changes are live.

```xml
we deploy -p projectID
```

##### See It Live

Great work, your app is now live! Now let's send an email.

1. Go to `ui-<projectID>.wedeploy.io` in your browser.
2. Fill in the form (make sure you put your email in the "to" field).
3. Click submit and check your email inbox because you've got mail!

Awesome! You just deployed an app and sent an email within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Wanting to make a pretty url for your primary UI service without purchasing a custom domain? Perfect, you can go to the _Custom Domain_ section of your service on the Dashboard and add a custom domain that ends with `wedeploy.io` (e.g. `yourapp.wedeploy.io`).
