###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Wanting to make a pretty url for your service without purchasing a custom domain? Perfect, you can go to the _Custom Domain_ section of your service on the Dashboard and add a custom domain that ends with `wedeploy.io` (e.g. `yourapp.wedeploy.io`).
