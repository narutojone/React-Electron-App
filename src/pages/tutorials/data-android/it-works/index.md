#### It Works

##### Deploy

Now that your API requests are ready, you can deploy your project again so that the changes are live.

```xml
we deploy -p projectID
```

##### See It Live

Great work, your app is now live! Now let's start playing with some data.

1. Run the app in the emulator.
2. Type an item into the input and click _Add Item_.
3. Click _Go to item listing_ and see how your data is already populated.

Awesome! You just created an app and saved data within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Wanting to make a pretty url for your primary UI service without purchasing a custom domain? Perfect, you can go to the _Custom Domain_ section of your service on the Dashboard and add a custom domain that ends with `wedeploy.io` (e.g. `yourapp.wedeploy.io`).
