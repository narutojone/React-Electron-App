#### Include API Client

Before we can make any requests to send an email, we must connect the WeDeploy API Client.

To do this, go to `tutorial-data-ios/app/Podfile` and include this line inside the target function of this file:

```swift
pod 'WeDeploy'
```

After doing this, you have to install the dependencies on the project, to do that open a terminal in that folder and execute the next command:

```swift
pod install
```

You will see all the dependencies being installed.
