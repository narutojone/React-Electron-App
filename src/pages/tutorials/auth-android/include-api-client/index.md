#### Include API Client

Before we can make any requests to create or sign-in any users, we must connect the WeDeploy Android API Client.

To do this, go to `tutorial-auth-android/app/tutorial-auth-android/app/build.gradle` and include this line inside the dependencies function of this file:

```text/x-groovy
compile 'com.wedeploy:com.wedeploy.android:@site.version.api.android@'
```

After doing this, you have to sync the project and then a few seconds later you will see that the project is built correctly.
